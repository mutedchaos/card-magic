# Solution

1. Run `npm i` to install `lodash`
2. Run `node .` to run the program
3. Example of the output logs in `barona-challenge.log`

# Programming Exercise

You have 60 minutes to complete and return this test. Evaluation criteria is
1) Correctness
2) Coding style
3) Speed

The final result should consist of source code in the language of your choice and the log print-outs explained later. You may use whatever on-/offline material you wish. 

Good luck and have fun!

## Create a deck of cards

Design data structures for representing a standard [deck of cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck). 

Implement code which creates a sorted deck of 52 cards in following order: Numerically smallest numbers first with suits in following order: Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs and Spades. Deuces shall be treated with numeric value of 2, Up to Aces with value of 14. 

Example sorting order:

```
Two of Hearts, Two of Diamonds, Two of Clubs, Two of Spades, Three of Hearts, ... Ace of Spades.
```    

Create a utility function which prints out the content of the deck.

## Prepare two decks

Clone the deck so you have two copies of the deck. Shuffle the other deck. 

## Perform a "magic trick"

You're a magician. Pick the original sorted deck and convert all the Aces in the deck into Queens. 

Print out both of the decks. 

Validate your answer by also printing out the number of cards per value. Example output:

```
Two: 4
Three: 4
...
Queen: 8
King: 4
Ace: 0
```    

## Results

Provide the log and the source code as the result. Both files and a link to a repository are acceptable. (However please rename the file suffix before sending it to pass email firewalls :)
